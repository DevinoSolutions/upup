## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#358](https://github.com/DevinoSolutions/upup/pull/358) [`ff8f74f`](https://github.com/DevinoSolutions/upup/commit/ff8f74fd5cd33525b491267b986d566e3e1d8b5b) Thanks [@BSalaeddin](https://github.com/BSalaeddin)! - Two follow-ups to the multipart hardening round:

    - **`resumable.maxConcurrentParts`** (default `3`): the parts-of-one-file
      concurrency cap is now public on the multipart config. More parts in flight
      buys throughput on high-bandwidth links and costs memory and sockets — each
      in-flight part holds its own chunk. Values below 1 are clamped to 1. This is
      a different axis from `maxConcurrentUploads` (files in parallel); the two
      multiply.
    - **`networkAware` is now a component prop** on every framework port (it was
      headless-only). It remains on by default — passing nothing keeps the
      offline-pauses / online-resumes behavior; `networkAware={false}` opts out.
      Omitting the prop deliberately forwards `undefined` so core's default-on
      applies.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#325](https://github.com/DevinoSolutions/upup/pull/325) [`79a2861`](https://github.com/DevinoSolutions/upup/commit/79a2861ffc6259485075ac54c85c564fd58c7b86) Thanks [@AminDhouib](https://github.com/AminDhouib)! - Redesigned default experience + refined component interface.

    **New default UI (all six frameworks, React-canonical):** a single selected
    file now renders as a `FileHero`; two or more render as a card list; source
    overlays gain a labelled `Back` action; file removal defers ~200ms for a
    smooth exit. A new `upup-fx-*` animation layer ships enabled by default.

    **Interface additions (`<UpupUploader>` props, identical across frameworks):**

    - `animations?: boolean` (default `true`) — decorative motion layer; `false`
      disables it (spinner/progress/focus always stay). Also forced off under
      `prefers-reduced-motion`.
    - `quietCompletion?: boolean` (default `false`) — on success, show only a
      brief checkmark and hand off to the completion callbacks/events (no Done
      button or summary), for apps that own the post-upload flow.
    - `imageEditor` now defaults on (React/Preact only) with a visible edit
      affordance; pass `imageEditor={false}` to opt out.

    **Non-visual:** all packages adopt `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` /
    `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`; `@upupjs/server` upload/drive routing is
    decomposed by concern behind a single CORS-safe responder. No breaking
    changes to the existing prop names or event contract — the additions are
    backward-compatible.
